A collection of programming problems I've thought up (ala Programming Praxis).

\problemsection{Away Goals}

\noindent In some major football championships, each match-up sees teams play in home and
in away conditions. Should there be a tie after two games, the winner is decided
by the \emph{away goals} rule: whoever scored the most goals while playing in
away territory wins that leg of the championships.

Given the results of the first leg of a match-up, determine how many goals do each
need to win the fixture.
\\

\problemsection{Input}

\noindent Each test case is made up of two lines indicating the score for each
team. It will also indicate who took the home ground for the first leg. The
format will be

\begin{verbatim}
(H) TeamName Score
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|(H)| will only be present for the home team. The team name will not
contain spaces.
