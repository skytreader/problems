\problemsection{Quine}

\noindent Write a non-empty Python program whose source code (assume that it is
named \verb|main.py|) has the following property:

\begin{verbatim}
$ python3 main.py >main_.py
$ diff main.py main_.py
$ # There is no difference!
\end{verbatim}

Note that this implies that \verb|main_.py| is a valid Python program as well and
can be executed to the same effect!

\textbf{You may not use I/O functions explicitly or implicitly, or make calls to
the guest OS.}

Extra points if your program defines a function to achieve this.
